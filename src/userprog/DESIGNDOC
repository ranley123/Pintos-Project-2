>> How do you avoid overflowing the stack page?
1. split the command line into tokens and read them into an array argv[] in order. The order should be the same as the little endian.
2. A function push_args() to push arguments from the argv[], from tail to head. In this way, I make sure they are in the right order. For each argument, I stored its address in a new array. After pushing all values of arguments, addresses of them are pushed into the stack, and then more elements are pushed based on the requirement.
3. During pushing, the word alignment is kept.

I did not design for the overflowing checking. My implementation did not consider the stack space in advance. However, in further implementation, overflowing can be treated as an exception and I can handle it later in the try-catch block, where exit(-1) is used. This approach is simple and makes sense.


---- RATIONALE ----

>> A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()?
The save_ptr (placeholder) in strtok_r() is provided by the caller function. 
The remaining string is useful containing some arguments which might be used in future, so strtok_r() is better than strtok().

2. avoid invalid inputs before passing it into low-level system calls. Kernel failures can be avoided.

			     SYSTEM CALLS
			     ============

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

struct file_entry
{
    struct list_elem file_elem;
    struct file *file_addr;
    int file_descriptor;
};
This is to record each thread's file information, including address and list element, and file descriptor. It will be added into a list maintained by the thread whenever open() or close() happens.

struct PCB {
  struct thread* parent_thread;    /* the parent process. */

  bool waiting;             // whether it is waited by
  int32_t exitcode;         // the exit status
};
This is to record each process's information, including waiting status and exitcode status. After a thread is destroyed or exited, the information will be kept to be returned.

In thread.h, more attributes are added into the declaration
   uint32_t *pagedir;                // page directory
   struct list child_process_list;   // list of child processes
   struct list_elem child_elem;      // child element in the list
   struct semaphore being_waited_on; // semaphore for waiting
   struct list file_descriptors;     // this thread's file descriptors maintained
   int cur_fd;                       // the size of file descriptors

   struct PCB * pcb;

This is for its child processes and waiting condition. File descriptors are maintained and pcb is for recording its status after exiting.

>> B2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files.
>> Are file descriptors unique within the entire OS or just within a
>> single process?
Each file descriptor corresponds to a unique opened file. It is unique just within a single process, because each thread will maintain a list of file descriptors and file_entry to ensure uniqueness. A opened file's details can be located by its file descriptor.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: Describe your code for reading and writing user data from the
>> kernel.
Read
1. check if the buffer and buffer + size are both valid, if not then
exit(-1). The filesys_lock works to avoid concurrent problems. 
2. check if fd is for STDOUT or STDIN. If it is STDOUT, then release
the lock and return -1. If fd is STDIN, then retrieve keys from standard
input. After that, release the lock and return 0.
3. Otherwise, find the open file given the fd number from the list. Then use read function provided by filesys to read the file
4. Release the lock and return.

Write similar to Read
1. check if the buffer and buffer + size are both valid, if not then
exit(-1). The filesys_lock works to avoid concurrent problems. 
2. check if fd is for STDOUT or STDIN. If it is STDIN, then release
the lock and return -1. If fd is STDOUT, then write. After that, release the lock and return 0.
3. Otherwise, find the open file given the fd number from the list. Then use write function provided by filesys to write the file
4. Release the lock and return.

For a full page of data:
The least number is 1. If the first pagedir_get_page() retrieves a page back, no more retriving actions are required, since it is already apage of data.

The greatest number might be 4096 if it’s not contiguous memory. We need to check validness for every access. When it’s contiguous, the greatest number can be 2, we might need to check the starting pointer and ending pointer.


For 2 bytes of data:
The least number is 1. If the page has more than 2 bytes available, then we dont have to have another pagedir_get_page() and validness checking.

The greatest number is 2. If it’s not contiguous or if it’s contiguous but only it is 1 byte away from the end of the page, the we need to identify where is another byte.

Improvements:
None. 

>> B5: Briefly describe your implementation of the "wait" system call
>> and how it interacts with process termination.
In process_wait() do the waiting
1. check if the inputted PID to be waited is in the current process's child process list, if not exit(-1)
2. find the child process with the given PID, and read its PCB storing its status.
3. check if it is already waited by a proess. If so, exit(-1). Otherwise, set its PCB's waiting status to True. This can avoid waiting twice.
4. remove the child elem from the child process list and sema_down the waiting semaphore. Once the child process exit, then the semaphre will be 'up' and the parent process will be invoked.
5. after invoking, the parent process will return its child process's PCB's exitcode. PCB's exitcode will be updated by the current exitcode. We need PCB because after exiting, the thread will be destroyed and exitcode needs to be stored in a safe place.

We can use check_valid_page() and usr_addr() to validate pointers to addresses, and if they are mapped in the page directory. Taking read() as an example, the esp pointer and the three arguments pointers will be checked. If they are not valid, then exit(). The buffer will be checked based on the length. After that, they can be used.

When error is detected, We check whether the fault_addr is valid pointer, also using checking functions. If it’s invalid, terminate the process. Taking the bad-jump2-test as an example, it’s trying to write an invalid address, by using the checking functions I found it is invalid, so exitcode is -1 to be returned.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

Each process will have its PCB to record statues, and they are remained for parent processe after processes are destroyed. 

* P calls wait(C) before C exits
Invokes the child's waiting semaphore and sleep until child exits. The child exits with semaphore up so the parent is invoked. Then exitcode is retrieved and returned.

* P calls wait(C) after C exits
Since C is exited, it will not shown in P's child process list, so parent process directly exits.

* P terminates without waiting before C exits
The list inside P will be free, the lock will be released, since no one will
wait a signal except parent, condition don’t need to be signaled. When C tries
to set it’s status and find out parent has exited, it will ignore it and
continue to execute.

* P terminates after C exits
P can directly exit.


---- RATIONALE ----

>> B9: Why did you choose to implement access to user memory from the
>> kernel in the way that you did?
Validate the pointers and then access. This is simple but effective. Other provided functions are a little complicated.

>> B10: What advantages or disadvantages can you see to your design
>> for file descriptors?
1. easy to manipulate and identify
2. logically simple and intuitive. 
However, it increases space for thread and extra functions to manage them.

>> B11: The default tid_t to pid_t mapping is the identity mapping.
>> If you changed it, what advantages are there to your approach?
I didnt change it. It is intuitive and simple.
